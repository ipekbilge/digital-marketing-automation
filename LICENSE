### **Step 4: Add Project Media (Cover Image)**

1. You can add a project cover image by uploading it directly to your repository or adding it as a media link in the `README.md`.
   - If you're using an image, you can create a folder called `assets` or `images` and upload your cover image there.
   
2. Then, reference it in your `README.md`:

```markdown
![Project Cover](./assets/cover-image.png)
